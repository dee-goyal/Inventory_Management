# Stock Inventory Management System Using Machine Learning

Project Overview:

This project is designed to help businesses effectively manage their stock inventory by leveraging the power of machine learning. The system provides real-time insights and predictions about inventory levels, helping businesses make informed decisions about restocking, optimizing supply chains, and reducing waste.

# Key Features:

  1. Depletion Rate Prediction: The system predicts the rate at which products are being depleted from the inventory based on historical data. This helps businesses understand how quickly stock is being consumed.
  
  2. Monthly Depletion Estimates: Based on the predicted depletion rate, the system can provide estimates of how much stock will be used up over a month, allowing businesses to plan their restocking schedules more effectively.

   3. Warehouse Management Integration: The system also integrates with warehouse operations, providing insights into the current stock levels and optimizing the warehouse management process.

  4. Data-Driven Decision Making: By using machine learning algorithms, the system analyzes past inventory data to predict future trends, helping businesses reduce overstocking and stockouts, which can be costly.

# Who It's For:

Retailers: Businesses that sell physical goods and need to keep track of large inventories across multiple stores and warehouses.
E-commerce Companies: Online retailers that require efficient inventory management to ensure they can fulfill customer orders promptly.
Supply Chain Managers: Professionals responsible for overseeing the movement of goods from suppliers to customers, who need accurate inventory data to optimize logistics.
Manufacturers: Companies that produce goods and need to maintain raw material inventories as well as manage finished goods ready for distribution.
